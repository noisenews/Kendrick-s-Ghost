    <p><strong>COMPTON, CA / LIHUE, HI —</strong> For over a decade, Kendrick Lamar has been hailed as hip-hop’s messiah... <em>(full article continues below)</em></p>

    <h2>THE NARDWUAR SLIP</h2>
    <p>Fans resurfaced a now-viral clip from Kendrick’s 2015 interview with <strong>Nardwuar the Human Serviette</strong>. After a rapid-fire stream of questions about Compton record stores and obscure soul samples, Nardwuar abruptly asks: <blockquote>“Whatever happened to Canon?”</blockquote>
    Kendrick’s expression shifts. There’s a noticeable pause. He rubs the back of his neck, offers a tight-lipped smile, and replies:
    <blockquote>“He’s... doin’ his thing, man. You know. Hope he good.”</blockquote>
    A brief silence follows before Kendrick changes the subject entirely to his sneaker collection. Body language analysts and conspiracy vloggers have since dissected the footage, pointing out his microexpressions, dry swallow, and lack of eye contact.
    <blockquote>“You can practically see the NDA materialize in front of him mid-sentence,”</blockquote> said one YouTube commenter.</p>

      <strong>EDITOR’S NOTE:</strong><br>
      At the time of publishing, <em>NOISE</em> received a cease-and-desist from a Glendale law firm representing “a certain Compton-born artist.” We ignored it.<br>
